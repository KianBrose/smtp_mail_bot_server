    """Add a name or names to __all__.

    There are two forms of use for this function.  Most commonly it will
    be used as a decorator on a class or function at module scope.  In
    this case, ``thing`` will be an object with both ``__module__`` and
    ``__name__`` attributes, and the name is added to the module's
    ``__all__`` list, creating that if necessary.

    When used in its function call form, ``thing`` will be None.  ``__all__``
    is looked up in the globals at the function's call site, and each key in
    the keyword arguments is added to the ``__all__``.  In addition, the key
    will be bound to the value in the globals.  This form returns the keyword
    argument values in order.  If only a single keyword argument is given, its
    value is return, otherwise a tuple of the values is returned.

    Only one or the other format may be used.

    :param thing: None, or an object with both a __module__ and a __name__
        argument.
    :param kws: Keyword arguments.
    :return: In the decorator form, the original ``thing`` object is
        returned.  In the functional form, the keyword argument value is
        returned if only a single keyword argument is given, otherwise a
        tuple of the keyword argument values is returned.
    :raises ValueError: When the inputs are invalid, or this function finds
        a non-list ``__all__`` attribute.
